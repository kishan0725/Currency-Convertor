# Currency-Convertor

A currency converter is software code that is designed to convert one currency into another in order to check its corresponding value. In order to convert one currency into another, a user enters an amount of money and chooses the currency he/she wishes to check the monetary value of (e.g. 'Indian Rupee(INR)'). After that, the user selects one, or sometimes several other currencies, he/she would like to see the result in. In this application, I make use of five currencies.

1. Indian Rupee
2. US Dollar
3. Japanese Yen
4. German Euro
5. Taiwan Dollar

The output roughly looks like this:
